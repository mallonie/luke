[{"content":" Originally post to hackmd.io\nThis article covers getting a local Kind cluster setup with Flux and the self hosted git server Soft Serve.\nRequirements You will need to have the following installed:\ndocker installation kubectl installation kustomize installation flux installation kind installation soft installation Assumptions I am assuming the following things:\nRunning on Linux Familiar with: Docker YAML Git Kind kubectl Let\u0026rsquo;s get Started We need to run two copies of Soft Serve in order to be able to access and configure the software.\nDocker Run Soft Serve We\u0026rsquo;re going to start a local copy of Soft Serve in preparation for running a copy within the Kind cluster. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume that your Flux repository is located in /home/nalum/code/flux. You will want to setup a new environment variable: export PATH_TO_CODE=\u0026quot;/home/nalum/code\u0026quot;. This will be used to mount your local code to both the local copy and the copy running in the Kind cluster.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get a running instance of Soft Serve going with Docker:\n❯ docker run -d \\ --name=soft-serve \\ --volume=${PATH_TO_CODE}:/soft-serve \\ --publish=23231:23231 \\ --restart=unless-stopped \\ --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) \\ --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \\ charmcli/soft-serve:latest This will start the container and then create a few directories that are used by Soft Serve as follows:\n❯ cd ${PATH_TO_CODE} ❯ tree -d -L 1 . ├── flux ├── repos # Created by Soft Serve └── ssh # Created by Soft Serve You should also be able to ssh to the Docker Soft Serve:\n❯ ssh localhost -p 23231 And you should be presented with a TUI looking something like this:\nAt this point we have the basics of what we need. You will want to clone the configuration repository from Soft Serve:\n❯ git clone ssh://localhost:23231/config Cloning into \u0026#39;config\u0026#39;... remote: Enumerating objects: 38, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (38/38), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (38/38), done. remote: Total 38 (delta 11), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 Receiving objects: 100% (38/38), 11.98 KiB | 5.99 MiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (11/11), done. You can now configure (we\u0026rsquo;ll get to this later) Soft Serve to be ready for when it\u0026rsquo;s deployed on the Kind cluster. The configuration is done with YAML and the following is the starting config created by running the software:\n# The name of the server to show in the TUI. name: Soft Serve # The host and port to display in the TUI. You may want to change this if your # server is accessible from a different host and/or port that what it\u0026#39;s # actually listening on (for example, if it\u0026#39;s behind a reverse proxy). host: localhost port: 23231 # Access level for anonymous users. Options are: read-write, read-only and # no-access. anon-access: read-write # You can grant read-only access to users without private keys. Any password # will be accepted. allow-keyless: false # Customize repo display in the menu. Only repos in this list will appear in # the TUI. repos: - name: Home repo: config private: true note: \u0026#34;Configuration and content repo for this server\u0026#34; # users: # - name: Admin # admin: true # public-keys: # - KEY TEXT # - name: Example User # collab-repos: # - REPO # public-keys: # - KEY TEXT Setting Up Kind For the Kind cluster we need to mount the $PATH_TO_CODE onto one or all of the nodes running in the cluster. The following config will setup a cluster one node and the path mounted for use by containers deployed on that node:\nkind: Cluster apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4 name: dev nodes: - role: control-plane extraMounts: - hostPath: /home/nalum/code # Same value that is in $PATH_TO_CODE containerPath: /soft-serve readOnly: false selinuxRelabel: false propagation: None Get your cluster up by running the following (this will change your kubectl context):\n❯ kind create cluster --config dev-config.yaml Creating cluster \u0026#34;dev\u0026#34; ... ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.21.1) 🖼 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦 ✓ Writing configuration 📜 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️ ✓ Installing CNI 🔌 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾 Set kubectl context to \u0026#34;kind-dev\u0026#34; You can now use your cluster with: kubectl cluster-info --context kind-dev Have a question, bug, or feature request? Let us know! https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/#community 🙂 Kind Run Soft Serve Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve got the a default setup of Soft Serve and the Kind cluster running it\u0026rsquo;s time to run Soft Serve on the Kind cluster. We will define a Namespace, a Service and a Deployment to get this running on the Kind cluster.\nThe Namespace:\napiversion: v1 kind: namespace metadata: name: soft-serve labels: app: soft-serve The Service:\napiversion: v1 kind: service metadata: name: git namespace: soft-serve labels: app: soft-serve spec: type: clusterip selector: app: soft-serve ports: - name: ssh port: 23231 targetPort: 23231 protocol: TCP The Deployment:\napiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: soft-serve namespace: soft-serve labels: app: soft-serve spec: replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 4 strategy: type: RollingUpdate rollingUpdate: maxSurge: 1 maxUnavailable: 0 selector: matchLabels: app: soft-serve template: metadata: labels: app: soft-serve spec: containers: - image: charmcli/soft-serve:latest name: soft-serve ports: - containerPort: 23231 name: ssh protocol: TCP securityContext: allowPrivilegeEscalation: false readOnlyRootFilesystem: true terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log terminationMessagePolicy: File volumeMounts: - mountPath: /soft-serve name: repos readOnly: true securityContext: runAsUser: 1000 runAsGroup: 1000 fsGroup: 1000 volumes: - name: repos hostPath: path: /soft-serve type: Directory In the Deployment we are setting some specific security context information to make it so the container is running as the user who owns the directory that has been mounted into the Kind node and which we are mounting into the Pod.\nWhen you install a Linux distribution and create the main user for that install it will likely have the id 1000 for the User and the Group, you can double check this by running the following commands in your terminal:\n❯ id # Prints the User ID, Group ID and IDs of other groups the user is part of uid=1000(nalum) gid=1000(nalum) groups=1000(nalum),3(sys),90(network),98(power),962(realtime),964(docker),991(lp),995(audio),998(wheel) ❯ id -u # Only the User ID 1000 ❯ id -g # Only the Group ID (this is the main group for this user) 1000 This was used earlier when we started Soft Serve with the docker command to set the user:group for the container to run as.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s apply these resources to the Kind cluster:\n❯ kubectl apply -f soft-serve.yaml namespace/soft-serve created service/git created deployment.apps/soft-serve created Now if you run the command to get the Pods in the created Namespace you should see something like the following:\n❯ kubectl -n soft-serve get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE soft-serve-786fb9c9f8-2h4pl 1/1 Running 0 12s soft-serve-786fb9c9f8-vzxgw 1/1 Running 0 12s Configure Soft Serve Configuring Soft Serve is pretty simple, go into the config repo we cloned earlier and edit the config.yaml file (cut down file for brevity):\n... host: git.soft-serve ... repos: ... - name: Flux repo: flux private: false note: \u0026#34;Flux Kind Cluster Demo running Soft Serve local git server\u0026#34; ... We\u0026rsquo;ve changed the host name and added a new repository to the config. To have this repository appear correctly and be used by Flux within the Kind cluster we need to create a symlink from ${PATH_TO_CODE}/flux in ${PATH_TO_CODE}/repos:\n❯ cd ${PATH_TO_CODE}/repos ❯ ls -lah total 12K drwxr-xr-x 3 nalum nalum 4.0K Feb 24 09:18 . drwxr-xr-x 13 nalum nalum 4.0K Feb 8 13:05 .. drwxr-xr-x 5 nalum nalum 4.0K Feb 8 13:12 config ❯ ln -s ../flux ./flux ❯ ls -lah total 12K drwxr-xr-x 3 nalum nalum 4.0K Feb 24 09:18 . drwxr-xr-x 13 nalum nalum 4.0K Feb 8 13:05 .. drwxr-xr-x 5 nalum nalum 4.0K Feb 8 13:12 config lrwxrwxrwx 1 nalum nalum 7 Feb 24 09:18 flux -\u0026gt; ../flux If you have the repo setup already with a README that should display when you view it in the SSH TUI, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a repo setup let\u0026rsquo;s do a quick setup of git and add a README file to the flux repo, something simple e.g.:\n❯ cd flux ❯ git init Initialized empty Git repository in /home/nalum/code/flux/.git/ ❯ tee README.md \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOT heredoc\u0026gt; # Flux Kind Cluster heredoc\u0026gt; heredoc\u0026gt; Flux GitRepository Source heredoc\u0026gt; EOT # Flux Kind Cluster Flux GitRepository Source ❯ cat README.md # Flux Kind Cluster Flux GitRepository Source ❯ git add README.md ❯ git commit -m \u0026#34;Adding README\u0026#34; [main (root-commit) b83b100] Adding README 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+) create mode 100644 README.md In order to see this change in the SSH TUI you will need to restart the docker container e.g. docker restart soft-serve. Now when you ssh into Soft Serve running on your local docker install you will see something like the following:\nThe same can be done with the instance running on the Kind Cluster. Restart the running Pods e.g. kubectl --context kind-dev -n soft-serve delete pods -l app=soft-serve. Once the Pods have been recreated you can port forward to one of the running Pods e.g. kubectl --context kind-dev -n soft-serve port-forward soft-serve-786fb9c9f8-25wkc 23232:23231 In the above command I\u0026rsquo;ve port forward the Pods port 23231 to the local port 23232. So now we can ssh into the TUI on the Pod and see the same view as above.\nIn the normal day to day use with Flux you do not need to stop and start the Soft Serve instances unless you want to use the TUI and see the README file updates as the TUI only appears to update when there is a push to the repo.\nSetting up Flux In the flux repo setup a structure like the following:\n❯ tree -a -I .git . ├── clusters │ └── dev │ └── flux-system └── README.md We are going to export the Flux installation into the flux-system directory, you can do this as follows: flux install --export \u0026gt; clusters/dev/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml\nI won\u0026rsquo;t include the content of that file as there is a lot in it, but feel free to browse. Next we\u0026rsquo;ll want to create a gotk-sync.yaml and a kustomization.yaml. Which you can do as follows:\n❯ flux create source git flux-system \\ --git-implementation=libgit2 \\ --url=ssh://git@git.soft-serve:23231/flux.git \\ --branch=main \\ --interval=1m \\ --export \u0026gt; clusters/dev/flux-system/gotk-sync.yaml ❯ flux create kustomization flux-system \\ --source=GitRepository/flux-system \\ --path=./clusters/dev \\ --prune=true \\ --interval=1m \\ --export \u0026gt;\u0026gt; clusters/dev/flux-system/gotk-sync.yaml ❯ cd clusters/dev/flux-system ❯ kustomize create --autodetect ❯ cd ../../.. ❯ tree -a -I .git -I vendor . ├── clusters │ └── dev │ └── flux-system │ ├── gotk-components.yaml │ ├── gotk-sync.yaml │ └── kustomization.yaml └── README.md It is also worth adding the resource above that created the Soft Serve deployment we are using and setting up the kustomization.yaml for that directory:\n❯ tree -a -I .git . ├── clusters │ └── dev │ ├── flux-system │ │ ├── gotk-components.yaml │ │ ├── gotk-sync.yaml │ │ └── kustomization.yaml │ └── soft-serve │ ├── deployment.yaml │ ├── kustomization.yaml │ ├── namespace.yaml │ └── service.yaml └── README.md Now let\u0026rsquo;s apply the above flux-system resources to the Kind cluster:\n❯ kubectl apply -f clusters/dev/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml namespace/flux-system created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alerts.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/buckets.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/gitrepositories.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/helmcharts.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/helmreleases.helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/helmrepositories.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/kustomizations.kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/providers.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/receivers.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io created serviceaccount/helm-controller created serviceaccount/kustomize-controller created serviceaccount/notification-controller created serviceaccount/source-controller created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/crd-controller-flux-system created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cluster-reconciler-flux-system created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/crd-controller-flux-system created service/notification-controller created service/source-controller created service/webhook-receiver created deployment.apps/helm-controller created deployment.apps/kustomize-controller created deployment.apps/notification-controller created deployment.apps/source-controller created networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-egress created networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-scraping created networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-webhooks created Before we apply the sync file we need to setup a known_hosts file and an SSH Key that Flux can work with in order to pull from our Soft Serve repo. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the SSH Key:\n❯ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \u0026#34;flux-system\u0026#34; Generating public/private ed25519 key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/home/nalum/.ssh/id_ed25519): /home/nalum/code/ssh/identity ... +----[SHA256]-----+ To create the known_hosts file we need to get the public key of the Soft Serve server we\u0026rsquo;re running, we can do that with:\n❯ cat ${PATH_TO_CODE}/ssh/soft_serve_server_ed25519.pub ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMDYacTjeLH4ha6BDgWN3rXeh70GDYmaSVBw5UQg1FQ3 root@2dcd99be9aef Copy this public key into a new ${PATH_TO_CODE}/ssh/known_hosts file and put the domain name in front of it something like the following:\ngit.soft-serve:23231 ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMDYacTjeLH4ha6BDgWN3rXeh70GDYmaSVBw5UQg1FQ3 root@2dcd99be9aef Now that we have the SSH Key and the known_hosts file we need to create a secret that Flux will pick up, you can use -o yaml to see the output:\n❯ kubectl -n flux-system create secret generic \\ --from-file=identity=${PATH_TO_CODE}/ssh/identity \\ --from-file=identity.pub=${PATH_TO_CODE}/ssh/identity.pub \\ --from-file=known_hosts=${PATH_TO_CODE}/ssh/known_hosts \\ flux-system secret/flux-system created With that put in place we can then apply the sync file:\n❯ kubectl apply -f clusters/dev/flux-system/gotk-sync.yaml gitrepository.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/flux-system created kustomization.kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/flux-system created If you now run flux get all you should see something like the following:\n❯ flux get all NAME READY MESSAGE REVISION SUSPENDED gitrepository/flux-system True Fetched revision: main/7e12f0c main/7e12f0c False NAME READY MESSAGE REVISION SUSPENDED kustomization/flux-system False kustomization path not found: stat /tmp/flux-system2367946620/clusters/dev: no such file or directory False The Kustomization is not working here because we have not committed any of the files to the repo yet. If you run watch flux get all --all-namespaces and the add and commit the clusters folder and it\u0026rsquo;s contents, you will see the Kustomization reconcile itself:\n❯ flux get all --all-namespaces NAMESPACE NAME READY MESSAGE REVISION SUSPENDED flux-system gitrepository/flux-system True Fetched revision: main/b6e77db main/b6e77db False NAMESPACE NAME READY MESSAGE REVISION SUSPENDED flux-system kustomization/flux-system True Applied revision: main/b6e77db main/b6e77db False If you describe the kustomization object with kubectl you\u0026rsquo;ll see the resources that have been applied to the system through it:\n❯ kubectl -n flux-system describe kustomizations.kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io flux-system Name: flux-system Namespace: flux-system Labels: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name=flux-system kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/namespace=flux-system Annotations: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; API Version: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2 Kind: Kustomization Metadata: ...
