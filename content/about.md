This is a website where I will be putting up information about different subjects
that are of interest to me now and may be needed at points in the future. Mostly
it will be things of a computer related nature.

Currently there is no tracking on this site and I do not make use of Cookies.

The theme toggle between light and dark makes use of the browser local storage,
by default the dark theme is used and if you choose to switch a `key=value` pair
will be created with the following data `perf-theme=light`. Each time you change
the theme the value will change between `light` and `dark`.

[utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/) also adds a local storage `key=value` that is
used to maintain your session with GitHub allowing you to comment on any of the
content on this website. The key for this is `utterances-session` and the value
will be your session id if you have logged in to GitHub with the comment system.
